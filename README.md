# inteltag

The purpose of this test script is analyze an hashtag of interest.

The mission is find users and hashtags associated with the target term.

For now is a very simple but (i hope) helpful script for OSINT, maybe in future i will add other functions.
Tested in Parrot 3.1

Usage: Install links2 (sudo apt-get install links2)

Then start with the command: bash inteltag.sh
